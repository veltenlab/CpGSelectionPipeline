# CpGSelectionPipeline

This repository comprises scripts to select CpGs from bulk DNA methylation data for subsequent analysis with scTAM-seq. 

In general, three classes of CpGs are selected:
- Differentially Methylated CpGs (DMCs, in [RnBeads](RnBeads))
- Intermediately Methylated CpGs (IMCs, in [IMS](IMS))
- CpGs harboring Within-Sample Heterogeneity (WSH, in [WSH](WSH))
